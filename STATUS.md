## Commands

This section lists the state of play for the different binaries.

The **compiles** column is whether or not we've fixed the V7 sources to
build on a Venix host.

The **runs** column is whether or not the resulting binary appears to work
correctly.

The **identical** column is whether or not the binary we have is
identical to the Venix 2.0R reference binary, or in some cases the
2.1R reference binary.

The **emulator** colum is the status of the binary when run with the
86sim Venix emulation program. this column isn't up to date.
