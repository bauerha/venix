To create a XFER diskette ...

	1) Make a copy of the distributed XFER diskette by using
	   the "dd" utility onto another diskette (if you only
	   have 1 floppy drive, then you will need to transfer
	   via a temporary file on the winchester).

	2) If the target machine has a different BIOS from an IBM
	   compatable, then remake the floppy and winnie bootstraps
	   in ../uboot.  Copy the "fboot" file to "/dev/f0"; this
	   will put the new bootstrap on top of the just copied XFER
	   diskette.

	3) Mount the XFER diskette in "/f0" and copy over the following
	   files if modified:
		install		-->	/f0/etc/init
		ddisk		-->	/f0/bin/ddisk
		../uboot/xtboot	-->	/f0/uboot/xtboot
		../conf/venix.f	-->	/f0/venix

	4) Unmount and test (and repeat until it works).

	The "install" program should only need to be modified if
	partitioning or winchester sizes change, or if the menu
	selections are inappropiate for the target machine.

	"venix.f" will probably always have been modified, as when
	changing device drivers or parameters.  Note that "install"
	changes the root device from "floppy" to "winchester" when
	it copies the "venix" image on the floppy to the winchester.
