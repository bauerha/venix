This directory contains the original VENIX 2.1 diskettes in tar format. The physical diskettes have been reblocked, converted and extracted, this is the actual contents.

The XFER image is 'as is', dd it to a diskette and it will boot, even  on a 1.44MB diskette, although only 360k will be recognized. 

The reconfig files and the sys directory under RECONFIG contains sources and libraries to rebuild the kernel, somewhat BSD style at the time, bnut not quite. There are a number of extraneous files oriniating from development processes eona ago. I do not have the original diskettes for the reconfig kit.
