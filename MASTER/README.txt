This directory contains the original VENIX 2.1/86 diskettes in tar format. The physical diskettes have been reblocked, converted and extracted, this is the actual contents.

The XFER image is 'as is', dd it to a 360k diskette and it will boot. Padding is needed if the destination diskette is of a different size. Tool to do that eslewhere.

The reconfig files and the sys directory under RECONFIG contains sources and libraries to rebuild the kernel, somewhat BSD style at the time, but not quite. There are a number of extraneous files origiating from development processes eons ago. I do not have the original diskettes for the reconfig kit.
